# Dev Diary

In this document, I'm going to track my learning and any decisions I'm making as the project evolves.

## First Steps -- Language and Application Type

One fundamental choice is what language to use, and for this project, the answer is somewhat dictated by what I want to learn more about. I know I need to build skill in larger-scale Python code, so I'm going to write the backend in Python. At some point, I expect to need a front-end framework and language, but I'm going to defer that decision until I get there.

I know how to build command-line tools and desktop applications, so although that might normally be a good first step for this type of tool, I'm not too interested in spending time on that. I will if it's the only way to get something runnable quickly, but I'm hoping to find a simple way to get a web application running locally so I can start building that from the beginning.
